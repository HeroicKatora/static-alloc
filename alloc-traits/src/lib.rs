//! Traits to replace or supplement the alloc module in `no_std`.
//! 
//! Defines traits, similar to `alloc::GlobalAlloc`, that can be implemented to defined different
//! kinds of allocators. Unlike the standard library one they do not presume global uniqueness and
//! static lifetime of the memory resource provider. In return, the allocators are not required to
//! implement the `Sync` bound and can easily be built without operating system support to be
//! usable.
//! 
//! There are additional independent crates with additional abstractions on-top:
//! * [`static-alloc`]: A simple allocator drawing from a memory region statically
//!   embedded within the compiled binary.
//! * [`without-alloc`]: A set of data structures (`Box`, `Vec`, `Rc`, ...) that can
//!   be allocated from the implementors of the traits defined here.

//! [`without-alloc`]: https://crates.io/crates/without-alloc
