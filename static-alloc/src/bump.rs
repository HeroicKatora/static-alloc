/// Allocator drawing from an inner, statically sized memory resource.
///
/// The type parameter `T` is used only to annotate the required size and alignment of the region
/// and has no futher use. Note that in particular there is no safe way to retrieve or unwrap an
/// inner instance even if the `Bump` was not constructed as a shared global static. Nevertheless,
/// the choice of type makes it easier to reason about potentially required extra space due to
/// alignment padding.
///
/// This type is *always* `Sync` to allow creating `static` instances. This works only because
/// there is no actual instance of `T` contained inside.
///
/// ## Usage as global allocator
///
/// You can use the stable rust attribute to use an instance of this type as the global allocator.
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use static_alloc::Bump;
///
/// #[global_allocator]
/// static A: Bump<[u8; 1 << 16]> = Bump::uninit();
///
/// fn main() { }
/// ```
///
/// Take care, some runtime features of Rust will allocate some memory before or after your own
/// code. In particular, it was found to be be tricky to predict the usage of the builtin test
/// framework which seemingly allocates some structures per test.
///
/// ## Usage as a non-dropping local allocator
///
/// It is also possible to use a `Bump` as a stack local allocator or a specialized allocator. The
/// interface offers some utilities for allocating values from references to shared or unshared
/// instances directly. **Note**: this will never call the `Drop` implementation of the allocated
/// type. In particular, it would almost surely not be safe to `Pin` the values, except if there is
/// a guarantee for the `Bump` itself to not be deallocated either.
///
/// ```rust
/// use static_alloc::Bump;
///
/// let local: Bump<[u64; 3]> = Bump::uninit();
///
/// let one = local.leak(0_u64).unwrap();
/// let two = local.leak(1_u64).unwrap();
/// let three = local.leak(2_u64).unwrap();
///
/// // Exhausted the space.
/// assert!(local.leak(3_u64).is_err());
/// ```
///
/// Mind that the supplied type parameter influenced *both* size and alignment and a `[u8; 24]`
/// does not guarantee being able to allocation three `u64` even though most targets have a minimum
/// alignment requirement of 16 and it works fine on those.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use static_alloc::Bump;
/// // Just enough space for `u128` but no alignment requirement.
/// let local: Bump<[u8; 16]> = Bump::uninit();
///
/// // May or may not return an err.
/// let _ = local.leak(0_u128);
/// ```
///
/// Instead use the type parameter to `Bump` as a hint for the best alignment.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use static_alloc::Bump;
/// // Enough space and align for `u128`.
/// let local: Bump<[u128; 1]> = Bump::uninit();
///
/// assert!(local.leak(0_u128).is_ok());
/// ```
///
/// ## Usage as a (local) bag of bits
///
/// It is of course entirely possible to use a local instance instead of a single global allocator.
/// For example you could utilize the pointer interface directly to build a `#[no_std]` dynamic
/// data structure in an environment without `extern lib alloc`. This feature was the original
/// motivation behind the crate but no such data structures are provided here so a quick sketch of
/// the idea must do:
///
/// ```
/// use core::alloc;
/// use static_alloc::Bump;
///
/// #[repr(align(4096))]
/// struct PageTable {
///     // some non-trivial type.
/// #   _private: [u8; 4096],
/// }
///
/// impl PageTable {
///     /// Avoid stack allocation of the full struct.
///     pub unsafe fn new(into: *mut u8) -> &'static mut Self {
///         // ...
/// #       &mut *(into as *mut Self)
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Allocator for pages for page tables. Provides 64 pages. When the
/// // program/kernel is provided as an ELF the bootloader reserves
/// // memory for us as part of the loading process that we can use
/// // purely for page tables. Replaces asm `paging: .BYTE <size>;`
/// static Paging: Bump<[u8; 1 << 18]> = Bump::uninit();
///
/// fn main() {
///     let layout = alloc::Layout::new::<PageTable>();
///     let memory = Paging.alloc(layout).unwrap();
///     let table = unsafe {
///         PageTable::new(memory.as_ptr())
///     };
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A similar structure would of course work to allocate some non-`'static' objects from a
/// temporary `Bump`.
///
/// ## More insights
///
/// The ordering used is currently `SeqCst`. This enforces a single global sequence of observed
/// effects on the slab level. The author is fully aware that this is not strictly necessary. In
/// fact, even `AcqRel` may not be required as the monotonic bump allocator does not synchronize
/// other memory itself. If you bring forward a PR with a formalized reasoning for relaxing the
/// requirements to `Relaxed` (llvm `Monotonic`) it will be greatly appreciated (even more if you
/// demonstrate performance gains).
///
/// WIP: slices.
pub struct Bump<T> {
    /// While in shared state, an monotonic atomic counter of consumed bytes.
    ///
    /// While shared it is only mutated in `bump` which guarantees its invariants. In the mutable
    /// reference state it is modified arbitrarily.
    consumed: AtomicUsize,

    /// Outer unsafe cell due to thread safety.

    /// on the bytes themselves, and hence drop etc must not assumed inited.
